## My process
- I will first create a mobile version of the webpage.
- Heading
- 4 Divs
- Desktop version-
- Combined 2 middle divs together in a div
- All 3 divs(Supervisor, Team Builder & Karma, Calculator) are floated to left
- Kept in mind to keep the width same for these divs


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

- Could make the desktop version better in terms of margin for 1440px.
- Need to improve eyeballing the padding better. 
- I am not comfortable with the heading yet. It should be aligned left instead of center.
- Will look later at it in detail.
